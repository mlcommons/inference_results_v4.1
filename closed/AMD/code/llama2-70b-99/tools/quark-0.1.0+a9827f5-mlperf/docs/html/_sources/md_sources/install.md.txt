# Installation Guide

## Install from ZIP

1. Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) for the compute platform(CUDA, ROCM, CPU...). Version of torch >= 2.2.0.

2. Download the [ðŸ“¥quark.zip](https://xcoartifactory/ui/native/uai-pip-local/com/amd/quark/main/nightly/). Extract the downloaded zip file and there is a whl package in it.

3. Install quark whl package by

    ```bash
    pip install [quark whl package].whl
    ```

4. (Optional) Verify the installation by running `python -c "import quark"`. If it does not report error, the installation is done.

5. (Optional) Compile the `fast quantization kernels`. When using Quark's quantization APIs for the first time, it will compile the `fast quantization kernels` using your installed Torch and CUDA if available. This process may take a few minutes but subsequent quantization calls will be much faster. To invoke this compilation now and check if it is successful, run the following command:

    ```bash
    python -c "import quark.torch.kernel"
    ```

## Install from source code

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Then create and activate a conda environment using the command below:
    ```bash
    conda create -n quark python=3.9
    conda activate quark
    ```

2. Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) for the compute platform(CUDA, ROCM, CPU...). Version of torch >= 2.2.0.

3. Download and open repository 
    ```bash
    git clone https://gitenterprise.xilinx.com/AMDNeuralOpt/Quark.git
    cd Quark
    ```

4. Install other dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. Install the main component.

    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

6. (Optional) Verify the installation by running `python -c "import quark"`. If it does not report error, the installation is done.

7. (Optional) Compile the `fast quantization kernels`. When using Quark's quantization APIs for the first time, it will compile the `fast quantization kernels` using your installed Torch and CUDA if available. This process may take a few minutes but subsequent quantization calls will be much faster. To invoke this compilation now and check if it is successful, run the following command:
